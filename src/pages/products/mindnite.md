Mindnite was part of [The Producthunt Global Hackathon](https://blog.producthunt.com/the-product-hunt-global-hackathon-join-us-1cdee25c9608) -- a month-long competition to ship products.

The idea behind the project was to fix what I consider is the core problem of all the existing note-taking applications. Mainly, that they only work in a hierarchical, linear fashion. The brain does not.

Mindnite combines an Outliner tool with a mindmap, and has similar features to a simple word processor.

Development was put on hold when the competition ended, but I would very much like to pick it up again sometime in the near future.

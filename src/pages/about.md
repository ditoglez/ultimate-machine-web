"A Mathematical Theory of Communication" was published by Claude Elwood Shannon in 1948. In it, Shannon introduced the term "bit" and developed the concepts of information entropy and redundancy. Inventions that led to revolutionary changes in how data is stored and transmitted. All of which now are commonplace and integrated with the very fabric of information technology and the Internet. Without them, it's hard to imagine any form of digital communication at all.

Shannon was a genius known as "the father of Information Theory" and a "doctor of juggling". He played in the same league as Einstein, Newton and Alan Turing. In addition to all his valuable contributions to MIT, Bell Labs, science and the human race in general, he also invented a rocket-powered Frisbee, a flame-throwing trumpet, and designed a "mind-reading" machine, among many other things.

On his desk, one could find "The Ultimate Machine". A variation of Marvin Minsky's "Useless Machine", it looked like a box with only a single switch on it. When you toggled the switch, the box opened and a mechanical hand shot out to quickly press the toggle again to turn itself off.

> "I've always pursued my interests without much regard for final value or value to the world," he said cheerfully. "I've spent lots of time on totally useless things."

This website and my company are named Ultimate Machine, as a tribute to Claude Shannon. I want everything I do to embody his level of passion, curiosity, creativity, grit, and humor. I hope to be able to contribute to the world in positive ways, but it's never been what drives me.

## What to Expect

On these pages, I share my thoughts on whatever I find interesting, stuff I've made and some of my learnings I think others might find interesting. I'm a 33-year-old guy from Sweden. I've worked professionally with Software Engineering, UX and Graphical Design for 10+ years, primarily in the freelancing and start-up world. These days I'm a full-time [Indie Hacker](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=indie%20hacker), which means I work only for myself (in terms of time and ownership) building my products. I would like to share my entrepreneurial journey with anyone interested, while I improve upon my writing skills.

Human peak performance and health, in general, is also a big interest of mine. I've been in the military and I constantly challenge myself, both mentally and physically. I read and digest a lot of information because I'm curious, it helps me relax and I'm always eager to learn new things. When I read I tend to step outside of my comfort zone a bit and go beyond Software and IT. Anything that'll give me perspective on things will do. Lately, I've been learning about the mind, body, and longevity but I've also read Anna Kendrick's autobiography and Siddhartha.

While quantitative trading, investing and world economics also are interests of mine, I won't write much about it. I've tried once before, but it only ended up with lots of people asking me for stock tips. I will, however, try to incorporate the mindset, thoughts, and ideas required for being successful in trading with my other topics.

## Open Source

All of this website is open source. I'm open to pull requests of any size -- small and large. If you find issues with my spelling or grammar, open an issue on GitHub and I'll fix it -- or you can submit a pull request and fix it yourself. Same with UX or design bugs. Naturally, as this is my website, I'm open to edits, translations and such but not new content.

Thanks for your interest!

Mickel.
